Presentation - JavaScript client:
  * It is recommended to open and close connections to the server for each command, rather than keeping connections open indefinitely.
  * Complete "TODO" sections in the cli.js file.

Domain - Java server:
  * Create all necessary api classes.
  * Write a "response" class that models responses as objects.
  * Use JAXB/Moxy to serialize and deserialize client commands and responses.
  * Use an ExecutorService to handle a many-threaded situation.
  * Store all user data in the database instead of memory.
  * It is recommended to organize the JDBC code into DAO classes.

(The project should be able to handle files of any type or encoding.)
